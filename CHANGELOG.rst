Xonsh Change Log
================

Current Developments
====================
**Added:**

* New configuration utility 'xonfig' which reports current system 
  setup information and creates config files through an interactive
  wizard.
* Toolkit for creating wizards now available
* timeit and which aliases will now complete their arguments.
* $COMPLETIONS_MENU_ROWS environment variable controls the size of the 
  tab-completion menu in prompt-toolkit.
* Prompt-toolkit shell now supports true multiline input with the ability
  to scroll up and down in the prompt.

**Changed:**

* The xonfig wizard will run on interactive startup if no configuration
  file is found.
* BaseShell now has a singleline() method for prompting a single input.
* Environment variable docs are now auto-generated.
* Prompt-toolkit shell will now dynamically allocate space for the 
  tab-completion menu.
* Looking up nonexistent environment variables now generates an error
  in Python mode, but produces a sane default value in subprocess mode.
* Environments are now considered to contain all manually-adjusted keys,
  and also all keys with an associated default value.

**Deprecated:**

None

**Removed:**

* Removed ``xonsh.ptk.shortcuts.Prompter.create_prompt_layout()`` and 
  ``xonsh.ptk.shortcuts.Prompter.create_prompt_application()`` methods
  to reduce portion of xonsh that forks prompt-toolkit. This may require
  users to upgrade to prompt-toolkit v0.57+.

**Fixed:**

* First prompt in the prompt-toolkit shell now allows for up and down
  arrows to search through history.
* Made obtaining the prompt-toolkit buffer thread-safe.
* Now always set non-detypable environment variables when sourcing 
  foreign shells.
* Fixed issue with job management if a TTY existed but was not controlled
  by the process, posix only.
* Jupyter kernel no longer times out when using foreign shells on startup.
* Capturing redirections, e.g. ``$(echo hello > f.txt)``, no longer fails
  with a decoding error.
* Evaluation in a Jupyter cell will return pformatted object.
* Jupyter with redirect uncaptured subprocs to notebook.
* Tab completion in Jupyter fixed.

**Security:**

None

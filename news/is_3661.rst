**Changed:**

* custom startup scripts replaced by setup.py -generated (console) entrypoint scripts for both xonsh and xonsh-cat.
  This means xonsh.bat and xonsh-cat.bat are replaced on Windows by xonsh.exe and xonsh-cat.exe, respectively.

**Deprecated:**

**Removed:**

**Fixed:**

* Avoid startup error on Windows when py.exe chooses wrong python interpreter to run xonsh.
  When multiple interpreters are in PATH, 'py' will choose the first one (usually in the virtual environment),
  but 'py -3' finds the system-wide one, apparently by design.

* For xonsh-cat, avoid parsing and processing first (0'th) argument when invoked directly from OS shell.

**Added:**

* ``abbrevs`` expansion now allows for setting cursor to a specific
  position within the expanded abbrev. For instance
  ::

    abbrevs["eswap"] = "with ${...}.swap(<edit>):\n    "

  expands ``eswap`` as you type to environment context manager
  ``swap()`` syntax and places the cursor at the position of the
  ``<edit>`` mark removing the mark itself in the process.

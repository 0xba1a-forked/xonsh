Tutorial: Xonsh Extensions
************************************
Take a deep breath and prepare for some serious Show & Tell; it's time to
learn about xonsh extentions!

Overview
================================
Xontributions, or ``xontribs``, are a set of tools and conventions for
extending the functionality of xonsh beyond what is provided by default. This
allows 3rd party developers and users to improve thier xonsh experiance without
having to go through the xonsh development and release cycle.

Many tools anbd libraries have extension capabilities. Here are some that we
took inspiration from for xonsh:

* `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_: Extensions are just Python modules,
  bundles some entensions with the main package, interface is a list of
  string names.
* `Oh My Zsh <http://ohmyz.sh/>`_: Centralized registry, autoloading, and
  for a shell.
* `ESLint <http://eslint.org/>`_: Ability to use language package manager
  to install/remove extensions.
